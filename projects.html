                    <li>Designed and printed brake ducts for my GTI in ASA in order to cool the brake rotors.
                    I have a TTRS Big Brake Kit installed on my car and the OEM rotors are known to heat up due to the bad rotor fin design.
                    In order to save myself some money, instead of buying $1k 2 piece rotors, I built these ducts to cool the brakes for spirited drives and track days.
                    I have the 2017 Sport trim which means there are no fog lights on the bumper so I took advantage of the extra space.</li>
