                <ul>
                    <li>Designed and printed brake ducts for my GTI in ASA in order to cool the brake rotors.
                    I have a TTRS Big Brake Kit installed on my car and the OEM rotors are known to heat up due to the bad rotor fin design.
                    In order to save myself some money, instead of buying $1k 2 piece rotors, I built these ducts to cool the brakes for spirited drives and track days.
                    I have the 2017 Sport trim which means there are no fog lights on the bumper so I took advantage of the extra space.</li>

                    Whiteline rear sway bar, Whiteline LCA, 034 roll center ball joints, Powerflex rear trailing arm bushing and dogbone insert, and many many more parts.</li>

                    <li>Worked with a group to build an Android application with GPS and Wifi waypoints to be able to find your class at CSUDH. The campus isn't that big but it can still 
                    be confusing to find your class and GPS only works well outside. By using a 3rd party API, I was able to map out the school with waypoints and wifi points 
                    which made finding your class much easier.</li>
